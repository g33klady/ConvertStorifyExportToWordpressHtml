# Save Your Storify Stories!

With Storify going away, I needed to save my Stories! I have many blog posts linking to them (as I live-tweet conferences, and post my recaps that way).
So I decided to write a quick converter tool to take the JSON or XML exported from Storify and turn it into HTML that I can just paste into Wordpress and save there.

## This is in progress! Features to come:
---
* Handling XML files
* Processing entire directories, rather than single files at a time
* More unit tests!
